# Basic Form Design

[Week 1 day 2 Iron Yard Homework - individual project](https://github.com/samanthasheadavis/basicFormDesign)

In week one we were learning basic HTML markup, this homework was to stretch our form-creation muscles. We were given an image of a form to replicate and certain fields and field validations were required (i.e. the number of objects that one can levitate cannot go below zero). We then tested our forms with Request Bin to make sure they were fully functional.

### Languages/Tools
